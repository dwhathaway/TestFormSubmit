## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dwhathaway/TestFormSubmit/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Sample form

<form action="https://github.com/organizations/dwhathaway/settings/apps/new?state=abc123" method="post">
 Create a GitHub App Manifest: <input type="text" name="manifest" id="manifest"><br>
 <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<script>
 input = document.getElementById("manifest")
 input.value = JSON.stringify({
   "name": "Octoapp",
   "url": "https://www.example.com",
   "hook_attributes": {
     "url": "https://example.com/github/events",
   },
   "redirect_url": "https://example.com/callback",
   "public": true,
   "default_permissions": {
     "issues": "write",
     "checks": "write"
   },
   "default_events": [
     "issues",
     "issue_comment",
     "check_suite",
     "check_run"
   ]
 })
</script>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dwhathaway/TestFormSubmit/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
